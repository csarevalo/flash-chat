# Flash Chat

A simple messaging app developed using Flutter. As of Nov 6, 2024, the app is available on the web through [github pages](https://csarevalo.github.io/flash-chat/).

## Goal

Use Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase authentication to equip the messenger app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

## Acknowledgments
This was possible thanks to Dr. Angela and her course from Udemy: The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart. The app source code is my own but the app idea and most of the content is in reference to her teachings.
